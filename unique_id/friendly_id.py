""" Generates and decodes an unique invoice id, which can use characters
    to shorten its length.

Description: Invoice numbers like "0000004" are unprofessional in that they
             expose how many sales a system has made, and can be used to monitor
             the rate of sales over a given time.  They are also harder for
             customers to read back to you, especially if they are 10 digits
             long.
             These functions convert an integer (from eg an ID AutoField) to a
             short unique string. This is done simply using a perfect hash
             function and converting the result into a string of user friendly
             characters.
